# **CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Deploying to GKE using Kustomize**

Welcome to our repository! This project focuses on a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, deploying applications to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with the aid of Kustomize for manifest customization.

## **Workflow Trigger**

Our workflow is initiated when a pull request is merged into specific branches: `main`, `develop`, and `main`. This ensures that the CI/CD process is initiated only when code changes are finalized and ready for deployment.

## **Environment Setup**

Before diving into the CI/CD steps, we set up environment variables. These variables, some fetched from GitHub secrets, provide necessary context and credentials for the subsequent steps.

## **CI/CD Pipeline**

1. **Checkout Code**: The workflow starts by checking out the latest code from the repository.
2. **Authenticate with GCloud**: To interact with Google Cloud services, the workflow authenticates using a service account key.
3. **Configure Docker for GCloud**: This step ensures Docker can push images to Google's Artifact Registry.
4. **Build and Push Docker Image**: The application is containerized and the resulting Docker image is pushed to the Artifact Registry.
5. **Setup Kustomize**: Kustomize is downloaded and set up. It will be used later for customizing Kubernetes manifests.
6. **Get GKE Credentials**: To deploy to GKE, the workflow fetches credentials for the Kubernetes cluster.
7. **Clone k8s-infra and Deploy**: The `k8s-infra` repository, which contains Kubernetes manifests, is cloned using a deploy key. Then, Kustomize customizes the manifests, and the application is deployed to GKE.

## **Future Implementations and Enhancements**

- **ArgoCD Integration**: ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
- **Enhanced Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**: Get real-time metrics on application performance and set up alerts for any anomalies.
- **Automated Testing with SonarQube**: Continuous inspection of code quality.
- **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**: Define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

## **Conclusion**

Our GitHub Actions workflow provides a robust foundation for CI/CD. By considering integrations like ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, SonarQube, and Terraform, we can ensure a more efficient, scalable, and reliable deployment process.
